\title{Supply Demand Diagram With Local and International Supply}

\maketitle
\section{Slider Values}


We'd want sliders for $a,\ b,\ d,\ \gamma,\ and\ p^e$
 controlling the choke prices $a$ and the slope of the demand function $b$, the market power of local peaches $d$, timing of other fruit through $\gamma$ and the import price, which might be complex expectation, or a certain value.

We'd use these on the python side to compute the optimal
 $\bar p$ is the price fixed by the marketing board, and the revenue scenario this gives..
 

Details

\begin{enumerate}
\item $p^e$ is the price that the board expects imported peaches will sell for this week. (They may have the exact value. there is some room to consider the effect of guessing ) 

\item $\gamma$ is a shift parameter. - increasing $\gamma$ increases the slope of the basic supply demand  over the base slope (it is a multiplier for slope)

\item $a$ is the choke price above this price

\item $b$ is the basic slope of the demand curve   
\end{enumerate}
